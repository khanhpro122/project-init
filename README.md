This is the template to be used for ReactJS project at Nexlesoft, regardless it's for admin app or user app.

 The template has two packages: Starter-kit vs Full Package. The branch main is for the full package and the branch starter-kit is for the starter package.

 ## Starter-Kit
 Starter-kit is a minimal template from where you can start your project quickly instead of removing stuff that isnâ€™t needed. Below are quick notes on the starter-kit:

 - No Auth
 - No ACL
 - No i18n
 - Simple Navbar
 - Four pages (Two sample pages + 404 + Login)
 - No Customizer
 - No Axios
 - No Scroll to top
 - Use it if you donâ€™t want to clutter your project with extra libs which arenâ€™t required.

 ## Full Package
 This setup has all the things which you can see in the live demo. Except for that red Buy Now button ðŸ˜….

 With this, you have to remove things that you donâ€™t use or replace them with your content.
